#Literary Hangman

##Overview

Literary hangman is a web-based word-guessing game, where the word(s) for the user to guess are randomly selected from a selection of famous authors and their works. All letters of the word are hidden at first, and are revealed one by one as they are guessed by the player. 

The user guesses a letter of the word by pressing it on their keyboard. If the letter is in the word to be guessed, it is revealed on the page. Otherwise, it will be displayed in the "letters guessed" area and a life will be deducted from the counter. 

The player wins the game when all letters in the word have been guessed, at which point a new word will be randomly selected.
