      <p>I grew up in Florida with my two sisters, Sarah and Alison. I attended the University of Florida where I obtained a B.A. in English. Since graduation, I have worked as an Editor, Human Resources Assistant, and Procurement Analyst. My current role is Reliability Engineer. </p>

      <p>I have several hobbies that I enjoy in my spare time, including: reading, knitting, lockpicking, flying planes, and watching Netflix. </p>

      <p>I currently live in San Francisco with my cat, Duck. I am always eager to learn new things, and I'm currently working to expand my skill with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>
